We can scroll down past the code window to show the ChatGPT AI description, as follows:
In this example, we have a sorted array arr, and we're searching for the target element using the binarySearch method. If the target element is found, the method will return its index; otherwise, it will return -1 to indicate that the element is not present in the array. The provided main method demonstrates how to use the binarySearch method with a sample array.
Java code validation using Eclipse Java code
One requirement that we need to supply in order to fully validate the algorithm for the Binary Search, is a sorted array. So, we posed the question for the ChatGPT web application (https://chat.openai.com ). This question and the response are as follows:
Do you have an example of an efficient sort algorithm using a Java program to sort an array of integer values into ascending numeric order?
We get the response as follows:
â€œCertainly! One efficient sorting algorithm is the QuickSort algorithm. It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array into two sub-arrays, one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.
